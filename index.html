<h2>My Contribution</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I worked extensively on the trailer for the game</li>
  <li>In terms of game mechanics, I was in charge of the merchant store and helped out with the various tutorials</li>
  <li>I also implemented special items such as bombs and potions</li>
  <li>In terms of UI elements, I built the in-combat health and consumable UI and made minor contributions to other UI elements as well</li>
  <li>Finally, I helped with the scaling of the game, specifically ensuring that the coin economy is practical and doesn't allow the Merchant Store to become too over-powered</li>
</ul>
